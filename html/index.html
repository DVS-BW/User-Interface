<p>You do not have to live with domestic violence. Let us help you discover your path forward. We have designed an all inclusive calculator to help you figure out where you stand, and how much you need to get started independently. Our calculator will run through all of the major obstacles and find the amount that you really need to things going. From your debt to your groceries, we will make sure you know exactly what you need to know. The first step is knowledge. And knowledge is powerful.</p>
<p>We know that the first step is often the hardest, and that things can seem impossible. You are not alone. It is possible. Don't give up. Let's do this together.</p>

<h2>Testimonies</h2>

    <p>"We were married for 34 years. I kept to myself and away from anybody that might have realized what was happening. I had no idea how to be on my own. I am from a generation that stays by their husbands through most anything. I had never been alone. The only thing more scary than staying was the idea of leaving. There is so much that goes into staring all over and I was pretty overwhelmed. Thanks to this site, the one easy thing was figuring out what I needed to stay away for good."" -Diane</p>

    <p>"I started out with no money except what was on a joint bank account that I knew he would cancel as soon as he could. I had nothing. Not even a bookbag full of clothes. Even if I wanted other people to know about what was going on, I didn't know anybody well enough to call anyway. Our family would never believe me over him. So planning to leave was hard. This toolkit really helped me be realistic in how to get away and start over. The resources here are the reason I'm around today." - Mary</p>

    <p>"The social sterotype is that this kind of thing doesn't happen to real men. That somehow, I should be stronger than this. But it happened, it was real. I had become completely dependent on her and I had no idea how even to start getting away. Worse than that was that I lacked the confidence to even make the first move. With the resources here, I'm happy to say that I'm on way to better. I can't say it ever really is over in my mind, but at least it isn't getting worse." -Jacob</p>
